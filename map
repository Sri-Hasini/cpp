/*              map
it stores key value pairs and have unique keys
it stores in sorted order of keys 
key can be any datatype and value also can be anything
map<int,int> m;
map< pair<int,int>, int>m1;
m[{8,9}]=10;
m[1]=2; (or) m.emplace({3,2}); (or) m.insert({4,3}); for storing

we iterate it and it stores like a pair and accessed like a pair
for(auto it:m){
    //it takes {1,2} as a pair and first ,second is used to call them
    cout<<it.first<<" "<<it.second<<endl;
}
if we access m[1] then it prints the value corresponding to that key like 2
if no key is available it prints 0

if we want to know the address and then access 
-->auto it=m.find(3);
-->cout<<*(it).second;
this is used to access the corresponding element of that key using iterator
-->auto it=m.find(5);//if not there it points to m.end()

//used to find the occurance of elements (frequency)
map<int,int>freq;
        for(auto i:nums1){
            freq[i]++;
        }
