/*
linear search -> searched from starting to last 
binary search -> it will search on a sorted one by dividing or  splitting until we find...
eg: -we will fix the starting point as 'low' and ending point as 'high' and calculate 'mid'
    -on the next step we will check whether mid == target
    -if we found then we will break
    -otherwise check if mid<target or mid>target
    -if it is less then we will make high=mid-1
    -if it is high then we will make low=mid+1
    -we will continue this process until low<=high
    -if we didnt find it we will print -1
